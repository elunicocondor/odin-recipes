            Not only is Chicken Parmesan my favorite dish from my childhood, but it’s a family favorite around my house now, too.  It’s also one of the first meals I ever learned to cook on my own, because it’s so simple and yummy.

            <h4> Ingredients </h4>
            <ul>
                <li> Boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>
                <li>Salt and pepper</li>
                <li>Egg</li>
                <li> A splash of milk </li>
                <li>Dried bread crumbs (you can use Italian seasoned bread crumbs, whole wheat, or Panko bread crumbs)</li>
                <li> Grated Parmesan cheese</li>
                <li> Marinara sauce <a href = " https://thrivinghomeblog.com/slow-cooker-marinara-sauce-recipe/"> (PS: heres how you make your own) </a> </li> 
                <li> Shredded Mozzarella cheese</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            <h5> Step by Step! </h5>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 350°F.</li>
                <li>Spray a 9×13 inch baking dish or pan with cooking spray and set aside. (Or you can cover it in foil or parchment paper for easy clean up.)</li>
                <li>Cut the chicken in half lengthwise, creating chicken cutlets. So now your two chicken breasts have transformed into 4 thinner chicken breasts.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle the front and back of each chicken breast with salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>In shallow dish, whisk together egg and splash of milk. In another shallow dish combine bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese.</li>
                <li>Dip chicken breasts, one at a time, in egg mixture, turning to coat. Allow excess to drip off.  Then dip chicken pieces in breadcrumb mixture, turning to coat.  Shake off the excess.</li>
                <li>Place breaded chicken in greased 9×13 casserole dish and bake at 350° F for about 20-25 minutes, until it is no longer pink in the middle or the juices run clear.  (Note: To check doneness, make a small slit in the middle of one chicken breast with a knife and pull open to make sure it is white, not pink.)</li>
                <li>Top each chicken breast with a generous spoonful of marinara sauce. Spread sauce around the top of each piece of chicken.  Then, sprinkle a few tablespoons of mozzarella cheese over the top of each piece, as well. It’s hard to overdo the sauce and cheese, so go for it. (I actually probably under did it in my pictures!)</li>
                <li>Put chicken back in the oven for 5 minutes, until cheese is melted.  Serve warm over pasta.</li>
            </ol>
